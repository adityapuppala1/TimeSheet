# Product Roadmap

This is a living reference for where TimeSphere is headed, written against what's actually
built today (verified against the codebase, not aspirational) — see the README's feature
table and [Multi-tenancy](../README.md#multi-tenancy) section for the current state in full
detail. Every idea here is described in terms of the existing choke points it would extend
(`ai.service.ts`, `GlobalAISettings`, `PlanTierLimit`, the workers pipeline) rather than a
parallel system, because that consistency is itself part of what makes this codebase
maintainable.

## What already differentiates this product

Worth stating plainly before listing what's next, because these are structural choices, not
easy to retrofit into a competitor later:

- **Physically isolated per-tenant database**, not a shared table filtered by
  `organizationId`. Every other SaaS pattern in this space (Jira, Linear, most timesheet
  tools) uses row-level multi-tenancy. The practical consequence: an org's AI provider key,
  AI spend, SSO config, and every row of ticket/timesheet data live in a database connection
  no other tenant's request ever opens — see [README § AI, and every other per-org setting,
  cannot leak across tenants](../README.md#ai-and-every-other-per-org-setting-cannot-leak-across-tenants-by-construction-not-by-filter).
- **BYOK across 10+ LLM vendors** (Anthropic native, plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint —
  OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Gemini, Qwen, Kimi, Nvidia NIM, local
  Ollama/LM Studio) with per-call cost estimation, an `AIUsageLog` audit trail, and a
  configurable monthly budget ceiling enforced live. Most competitors either bundle one
  vendor's AI at a markup or have no AI at all.
- **Live plan-tier enforcement**, not just at signup — seat limits and AI budget ceilings are
  re-read on every relevant request (`services/plan-limits.service.ts`), so a platform admin
  changing a limit takes effect immediately, not on next billing cycle.
- **Tickets and timesheets are one system**, not two products bolted together — this is what
  makes workload heatmaps, cost-per-ticket, and estimate-vs-actual variance possible at all,
  because the same database holds both "the work" and "the time spent on it."

## Next-feature themes

Each is framed as an extension of an existing mechanism, not a new one.

### AI workflow automation

Audited 2026-07-17: none of the four items below existed yet (`ModuleAssigneeRule` is intake-
routing only, not a general ticket rules engine; `answerWorkspaceQuestion` is ticket-backlog-only,
not Insights-grounded; no anomaly detection or on-demand status report existed). Phased so each
step ships/tests/ships before the next starts, same discipline as the DevOps cluster above.

*Phase A — reuses existing infra, no new external credentials:*
- [x] **Rules engine on ticket fields** — new `TicketRule` model (condition: project/label/
  priority/source/senderDomain match; action: assign/label/notify), evaluated at the same choke
  point `ModuleAssigneeRule` already runs at (ticket-creation path), generalizing rather than
  replacing it. Admin CRUD lives in Workspace Settings → Ticketing.
- [x] **AI-suggested auto-assignment** — deterministic ranking (not an LLM call — see
  `ticket.controller.ts`'s `/suggest-assignee` route doc comment for why) from historical workload +
  expertise, rendered as a suggestion chip on ticket creation.
- [x] **Timesheet anomaly detection** — `GET /team/timesheet-anomalies`, opt-in manager insight
  (sustained overtime ≥55h/week, implausible daily total >16h) surfaced as a card on the Team page —
  informational only, same human-review posture low-confidence email triage already uses.
- [x] **AI-drafted status reports** — on-demand "generate a stakeholder update" for one project
  (`ai.service.ts#generateStatusReport`, `POST /reports/status-report`), triggerable from the
  Reports page rather than only firing on a schedule. Gated by its own `statusReportEnabled` toggle.

### Conversational analytics
- [ ] Extend `answerWorkspaceQuestion` (today: ticket-backlog Q&A only) into a conversational
  layer over the Insights dashboard's own aggregates (SLA trend, velocity, cost-per-ticket,
  workload) via tool-calling through the same `ai.service.ts` choke point — "why did our SLA
  compliance drop last month?" gets a grounded answer instead of requiring four separate charts.

### Integrations
- [x] **Public REST API + outbound webhooks** — already shipped (`public-api.controller.ts`,
  `webhook-dispatch.service.ts`) — see [docs/API.md § Public API](API.md#public-api).
- [ ] **Calendar sync** (Google/Outlook) — deadline-aware scheduling, reads the SLA due dates that
  already exist on tickets. Needs the org's own Google/Microsoft OAuth App credentials (same BYOK
  model as SSO/GitHub — no TimeSphere-operated client ever touches a customer's calendar).
- [ ] **SCIM provisioning** — enterprise directory-sync user lifecycle, pairing with the SAML/LDAP
  SSO that already exists per-org (SSO today authenticates but doesn't provision). Needs the
  identity provider's SCIM bearer token, admin-configured per org.

### Monetization readiness
- [ ] Self-serve Stripe billing wired to the existing `PlanTierLimit` model — turns the current
  "a platform admin manually assigns a tier" flow into a real upgrade/downgrade funnel. Needs a
  real Stripe account + API keys (test-mode keys are fine for initial build) before this can be
  live-tested end-to-end; the webhook-receiver/checkout-session code can be built and unit-tested
  without them, but a real Stripe test account is required to verify the actual payment flow.

### Engineering & DevOps integration suite

The biggest thematic gap today: TimeSphere tracks *the ticket* and *the time spent on it*, but
has no visibility into *the code that resolved it*. This theme closes that loop — git activity,
CI results, and security findings all flow onto the same ticket a developer is already working
in, and flow back out as automated ticket-state changes. Grounded in what already exists:
`User.managerId` (self-relation, already powers escalations/approvals/Team page) *is* the
TL/manager mapping — no new org-chart model needed, just new surfaces reading it. `Project` →
`ProjectModule` → `ProjectSubmodule` is the existing work-breakdown hierarchy a repo/branch maps
onto. `TicketLink` (`BLOCKS`/`DUPLICATE`/`RELATES`) is the existing cross-ticket-relationship
primitive a "caused a regression in" link would reuse.

**1. Git repo & branch mapping**
- New tenant-scoped tables: `Repository` (org's connected repos — provider, URL, default
  branch), `TicketBranch` (many-to-many: a ticket can have 0+ branches, e.g. a fix that spans a
  feature branch and a hotfix), `PullRequest` (linked PR: number, URL, status, author, linked
  ticket via branch-name convention `TICKET-123-...` or an explicit link action).
- Ingestion: a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket **App/webhook integration** (same shape as the existing
  Slack/Teams/Google Chat webhook receivers in `chat-webhook.controller.ts` — signature-verified
  per provider, org resolved from the webhook's configured URL, not a subdomain). Push, branch-
  create, and PR events land here.
- UI: a new **Dev** tab on the ticket detail sheet (alongside the existing Comments/Checklist/
  Linked/Files/Time logged/Activity tabs) — branch chips with CI/PR status badges, "create
  branch" quick-action that copies a conventionally-named branch string to clipboard.

**2. Auto testing on branch/PR push**
- New table: `TestRun` (ticket-linked via its branch/PR, provider — GitHub Actions/GitLab
  CI/Jenkins/CircleCI —, status, pass/fail counts, duration, log URL).
- Ingestion: CI systems POST a completion webhook (or TimeSphere polls the provider's API on a
  `node-cron` worker, same pattern as `chat-telegram.worker.ts`'s poll-not-webhook choice for
  platforms without one). A failing run on a ticket's branch surfaces as a red badge on the
  ticket card in the Kanban board — visible without opening the ticket.
- Workflow rule: a ticket **cannot move to `RESOLVED`** if its latest linked `TestRun` is
  failing (enforced server-side in the existing `ticketStatusTransitions` gate in
  `ticket.controller.ts`, the same choke point that already enforces the Kanban's legal-move
  rules) — configurable per-org (some teams want this as a hard gate, others as a warning).

**3. Security assessment suite — VAPT / DAST / SAST / SSAT / SSCT**

Five distinct assessment types, deliberately **ingest-only and tool-agnostic** rather than
TimeSphere running any scanner itself — the same architectural choice as everything else in
this cluster (TimeSphere aggregates and acts on signals from tools the org already runs, it
doesn't become a scanning vendor). This also sidesteps the real infra/liability lift of actively
executing pentest-class tooling (DAST/VAPT) against a customer's live systems, which needs
explicit authorization TimeSphere has no standing to grant on a customer's behalf.

| Type | What it checks | How it lands in TimeSphere |
|---|---|---|
| **SAST** — Static Application Security Testing | Source code itself, no execution (Semgrep, CodeQL, SonarQube, etc.) | Webhook POST from CI on every PR/push |
| **DAST** — Dynamic Application Security Testing | The running app, black-box (OWASP ZAP, Burp, etc.) | Webhook POST from a CI stage or the customer's own DAST pipeline |
| **SSAT** — Secrets & Sensitive-data Scanning | Hardcoded credentials/API keys/tokens committed to the repo (Gitleaks, TruffleHog, etc.) | Webhook POST from CI, same shape as SAST |
| **SSCT** — Software Supply Chain Testing | SBOM, dependency provenance, package integrity/typosquatting/compromised packages — broader than a plain CVE-only dependency check (Syft/Grype, Socket, npm audit's advisory feed, etc.) | Webhook POST from CI, generates/attaches an SBOM artifact link |
| **VAPT** — Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing | A periodic, human-led assessment (not per-PR — this app's own VAPT report in [README § Security](../README.md#security) is exactly this pattern) | A structured report (PDF/JSON) uploaded through Workspace Settings, parsed into the same `SecurityFinding` rows as the automated types |

- **Data model**: one generalized `SecurityFinding` table (ticket-linked where applicable, plus
  a repo/branch/PR reference) with a `type` enum (`SAST`/`DAST`/`SSAT`/`SSCT`/`VAPT`), `tool`,
  `severity`, `cwe`/rule ID, `file`/`line` where relevant, and `status`
  (`OPEN`/`ACKNOWLEDGED`/`FIXED`/`ACCEPTED_RISK`) — one table because a PR report needs to
  render all five types side by side, not five separate query shapes.
- **Auto-ticket creation**: a CRITICAL/HIGH finding of any type on a merged PR auto-creates a
  `SECURITY`-type ticket (severity mapped to priority, auto-assigned via the existing
  `ModuleAssigneeRule` mechanism) — high-confidence by construction (the scanning tool already
  did the classification), so this skips the AI-triage `needsReview` gate that email/chat intake
  needs; a finding is not an ambiguous natural-language message.
- **Per-PR structured security report**: the actual deliverable the user asked for — one report
  per PR aggregating every finding type above (plus the linked `TestRun` status from theme #2),
  rendered as an in-app page on the ticket's **Dev** tab and exportable as a PDF using the
  `pdfkit` dependency already in `apps/api/package.json` (currently only used for timesheet
  exports — this reuses that same code path rather than adding a second PDF library). Sections:
  a one-line risk verdict, findings grouped by type and severity, the SBOM link (SSCT), test
  status (from theme #2), and a "what changed since the last report on this ticket" diff so a
  reviewer isn't re-reading unchanged findings on every push.

**3a. Ticket-close security digest email**

When a ticket carrying at least one linked `SecurityFinding`/`TestRun` transitions to `CLOSED`
(the existing `PATCH /:id/status` route in `ticket.controller.ts` — the one choke point every
status change already funnels through, so this is one more notification branch there, not a new
code path), TimeSphere sends a structured summary of that ticket's security/test status — not
the org's whole security posture, just what's relevant to *this* ticket:

- **To**: the user who closed the ticket, and their manager (`req.user.manager`, read via the
  existing `User.managerId` self-relation — no new org-chart data needed).
- **Cc**: every `ADMIN`/`SUPER_ADMIN` in **that ticket's own tenant database** — never platform
  admins, never another org's admins. This falls out of the existing architecture for free
  rather than needing an explicit check: the query that finds "this org's admins" runs through
  the tenant-scoped `prisma` proxy described in
  [README § Multi-tenancy](../README.md#multi-tenancy), which physically cannot see another
  org's `User` table — there is no cross-tenant admin list to accidentally include.
- **Content**: the same per-PR report data as above, scoped to this one ticket's linked
  branch/PR/findings — not a digest of every open finding across the org, so a closer's manager
  isn't cc'd on unrelated projects' security noise.
- **Configurability**: a new toggle in `GlobalNotificationSettings` (next to the existing
  per-category email opt-ins already in Workspace Settings), off by default until an org
  connects at least one scan source — consistent with every other notification category's
  admin-configurable, opt-in-by-default-only-when-relevant pattern.
- **Delivery**: reuses `dispatchNotification`/`mail-templates.ts` exactly as every other
  ticket-lifecycle email does today (assignment, status change, comments) — one new template
  (`ticket.security_digest`), no new mail infrastructure.

**3b. Competitive parity & AI differentiation (Black Duck / OpenText Fortify benchmark)**

Researched 2026-07-15 against Black Duck SCA and OpenText Fortify (Remediation Aviator) — see
that session's chat for full source links. Verdict: the ingest-only, tool-agnostic architecture
above is already a better fit for a mid-market SaaS than either vendor's scanner-bundled
platform, and `autoReopenEnabled`/`ciFailureTriageEnabled`/`ModuleAssigneeRule`-based assignment
already match features both vendors sell as premium add-ons. The real gaps are SARIF ingestion
friction, exploitability-aware risk scoring, an analytics surface, and SBOM/license depth. Phased
so each phase ships, tests green, and is usable standalone before the next starts — no phase
depends on a later one being done to be valuable on its own.

*Phase 1 — fast wins, reuse existing patterns (ingestion + assignment):*
- [ ] **SARIF ingestion adapter** — `POST /api/devops/:orgSlug/findings/sarif` (or content-type
  sniffing on the existing `/findings` route) accepts a raw SARIF 2.1.0 document and maps its
  `runs[].results[]` into the existing `SecurityFinding` shape — GitHub Code Scanning,
  `codeql-action`, `semgrep --sarif`, and Azure DevOps' native scan output all land with zero
  hand-written `jq` translation, closing the single biggest onboarding-friction gap vs.
  GitHub/Azure's built-in code scanning.
- [ ] **Finding-level auto-reopen** — extend `autoReopenEnabled`'s trigger beyond failing
  `TestRun`s to "a new/reintroduced finding lands against a RESOLVED/CLOSED ticket's linked
  repo+branch," mirroring Black Duck's Jira-plugin `BOM_EDIT`-triggered reopen. Same
  `security-report.service.ts` function (`maybeAutoReopen` or equivalent), one more call site.
- [x] **Severity/policy-based ticket auto-creation** — already shipped: any CRITICAL/HIGH finding
  with no `ticketKey` match auto-creates a `SECURITY`-type ticket (`maybeAutoCreateTicketForFinding`
  in `security-report.service.ts`), assignee resolved through the existing `ModuleAssigneeRule`
  chain, same `dispatchTransactional` notify path already wired. Verified during this phase's
  research pass — no new code needed here.
- [ ] **CODEOWNERS/last-committer assignment fallback** — when no `ModuleAssigneeRule` matches a
  finding's `filePath`, resolve an assignee via the repo's `CODEOWNERS` file or the last
  committer on that file (both fetched through the existing `GitConnection` OAuth token, cached
  per repo) before falling back to unassigned. This is the concrete "assign to the relevant
  person" ask — closer to GitHub's own code-scanning alert assignment than either vendor's
  Jira-plugin approach.

*Phase 2 — analytics surface (net-new page, medium effort, depends on Phase 1's data existing):*
- [x] **Security & DevOps analytics page** (`/app/security-insights`, `REPORTS_VIEW`-gated):
  findings-over-time trend (8-week `AreaChart`), open-by-severity breakdown, mean-time-to-remediate
  (approximated from `updatedAt - createdAt` — no dedicated resolvedAt column on `SecurityFinding`
  yet), top repositories by open-finding count, SAST/DAST/SSAT/SSCT/VAPT split (`BarChart`) — built
  on the `StatCard`/`computeTrend` shared components, backed by `GET /reports/security-insights`.
  Nav entry + command-palette entry added alongside the existing Insights page.
- [x] **Org-wide risk score** — weighted, age-decayed formula (critical×10/high×5/medium×2/low×1,
  halving influence every 30 days a finding stays open, floored at 25%) as a Dashboard `StatCard`
  for admins, plus its own tile on the Security insights page.

*Phase 3 — AI differentiation (the actual moat: TimeSphere owns timesheet + org data neither
vendor has):*
- [x] **AI exploitability triage on findings** — sibling toggle to `ciFailureTriageEnabled`
  (`GlobalAISettings.findingTriageEnabled`), scoped to `SecurityFinding` rows (CRITICAL/HIGH
  only, bounding spend): `ai.service.ts#classifySecurityFinding` classifies TRUE_POSITIVE/
  FALSE_POSITIVE/NEEDS_REVIEW + suggests a fix, same shape as Fortify Aviator but built on the
  existing BYOK pipeline. Writes onto the `SecurityFinding` row itself (new `aiVerdict`/
  `aiExploitability`/`aiFixSuggestion`/`aiTriagedAt` columns) so it shows regardless of whether
  the finding has a ticket, plus posts as a ticket comment when it does. Renders on the ticket
  Security tab.
- [x] **Velocity-aware assignee suggestion** — when a CODEOWNERS line lists several people,
  `pickFastestAssignee` (security-report.service.ts) picks whoever has historically resolved
  security-linked tickets fastest (mean `Ticket.createdAt`→`resolvedAt` across their own
  RESOLVED/CLOSED tickets carrying a `SecurityFinding`), falling back to the first candidate on a
  cold start. Neither Black Duck nor Fortify can do this because neither owns ticket-resolution
  history — this is the product's real differentiator.
- [x] **AI weekly security digest** — new `workers/security-weekly-digest.worker.ts` (Monday
  08:30, 30 min after the per-user digest), generalizing `weekly-digest.worker.ts`'s pattern:
  open-findings trend, newly-critical items this week, resolved-this-week, risk-score delta,
  tickets stuck past SLA, top repos — one org-wide email to every ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN. Two-layer
  gated like the existing weekly digest (`GlobalAISettings.securityWeeklyDigestEnabled` decides
  whether it runs at all, `GlobalNotificationSettings.emailSecurityWeeklyDigest` whether it
  actually emails), skips weeks with nothing to report.
- [x] **SBOM ingestion** (`POST /api/devops/:orgSlug/sbom`, SPDX/CycloneDX, new `SbomComponent`
  table) — a basic "dependency inventory + known-CVE cross-reference" view (ecosystem parsed
  from `purl`, CVE cross-referenced from CycloneDX's `vulnerabilities[].affects` where present),
  surfaced on the Security insights page. Deliberately not attempting Black Duck's full
  license-obligation-text depth (low ROI for this product's target market — legal-team-grade
  tooling most mid-market customers won't use).

**4. AI auto bug/issue detection + auto-reopen** ✅ shipped (Phase 4, 2026-07-16)
- [x] **Error-tracking ingestion + fingerprint-based auto-reopen** —
  `POST /api/devops/:orgSlug/error-events` accepts Sentry/Rollbar's outbound webhook shape (or a
  raw `{source, fingerprint, message, stackTrace?, level?, ticketKey?}` payload from any other
  system). A new event with no explicit `ticketKey` still auto-reopens a RESOLVED/CLOSED ticket
  if its `fingerprint` matches the fingerprint stored on that ticket from an earlier event (new
  `Ticket.errorFingerprint` column, first-write-wins) — reuses the exact same
  `maybeReopenTicketOnRegression` + `IngestionSettings.autoReopenEnabled` gate every other
  regression trigger in this app already goes through, so "the same crash came back" needed zero
  new state-machine logic. When a `stackTrace` is supplied, reuses `maybePostCiFailureTriageComment`
  (the existing CI-failure AI triage, gated by `GlobalAISettings.ciFailureTriageEnabled`) rather
  than building a second AI classifier for what's structurally the same "summarize this failure
  text" task.
- [x] **AI PR-review summary** — already shipped in an earlier phase
  (`ai.service.ts#summarizePullRequest`, `GlobalAISettings.aiPrReviewSummaryEnabled`,
  `git-webhook.controller.ts`'s PR-opened handler) — confirmed still working, no new code needed.

**5. TL/Manager mapping — new surfaces on existing data**
- An **org-chart / reporting-line view** (Team page today shows direct reports + escalations in
  two flat tables — extend with a tree view using the existing `manager`/`reports` self-relation,
  no schema change).
- **Kanban swimlanes by reporting line** — group the existing ticket board by
  `assignee.managerId` so a manager sees their team's work grouped, without a new permission
  model (reuses `ticketProjectScope` + the existing manager/team-lead visibility rules already
  enforced server-side).

**UI/UX approach for this whole cluster**: everything above surfaces on components that already
exist — the ticket detail sheet gets one more tab, the Kanban card gets a couple more status
badges, the Team page gets a tree view alongside its existing tables, Workspace Settings gets one
more settings card (**Integrations → Git & CI**, next to the existing Email intake/Chat
integrations cards, same layout/toggle pattern). No new page-level navigation is needed except a
single new **Dev** tab — consistent with the "don't add features, add to what's already load-
bearing" principle the rest of this codebase follows.

### Monetization readiness
Self-serve billing (Stripe) wired to the existing `PlanTierLimit` model. Today tiers are an
in-app flag a platform admin sets manually (see README's Multi-tenancy section) — no payment
processor exists. This is what turns the current "manually assign a tier" flow into an actual
upgrade/downgrade self-serve funnel.

## Tier mapping

Reuses the exact mechanism already in place — a feature is either an **org-admin toggle**
(Workspace Settings, same pattern as every existing AI/SSO/chat-integration toggle) gated by
what the org's plan tier allows, or a **platform-admin-only lever** (plan-tier config, same
`PlanTierLimit` table AI budget/seats/SSO-providers/chat-platforms already use today).

| Feature | Free / Starter | Team | Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rules-engine auto-assignment/labeling | — | ✓ (capped rule count) | ✓ (unlimited) |
| AI-suggested auto-assignment | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Timesheet anomaly detection | — | — | ✓ |
| AI-drafted status reports | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Conversational analytics ("Ask AI" over Insights) | — | ✓ (capped queries/mo, same budget-ceiling pattern as today's AI features) | ✓ |
| Public API + webhooks | — | Read-only API | Full API + webhooks |
| Calendar sync | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| SCIM provisioning | — | — | ✓ |
| Git repo/branch/PR mapping | — | ✓ (1 repo) | ✓ (unlimited) |
| Auto testing status on tickets | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| SAST / SSAT (secrets) ingestion | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| DAST / SSCT (supply chain) ingestion | — | — | ✓ |
| VAPT report upload + parsing | — | — | ✓ |
| Auto security-finding tickets | — | — | ✓ |
| Per-PR structured security report (PDF) | — | ✓ (SAST/SSAT only) | ✓ (all 5 types) |
| Ticket-close security digest email | — | — | ✓ |
| AI CI-failure triage + auto-reopen | — | — | ✓ (opt-in toggle, see above) |
| AI PR-review summaries | — | ✓ (capped/mo, same budget-ceiling pattern) | ✓ |
| Org-chart / reporting-line views | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (no gating — reads data every tier already has) |

Every row above governs cost/usage the same way `GlobalAISettings.monthlyBudgetUsd` +
`AIUsageLog` already do for existing AI features — no new governance model needed, just new
things flowing through the existing meter.

## Explicitly out of scope for now

Captured here so it isn't silently forgotten, not because it's undesirable:

- Native mobile app — no current signal this is blocking a deal; revisit if requested.
- Data residency / region selection — relevant once there's an actual EU/regulated customer.
- Per-org custom domains beyond subdomain routing — nice-to-have, not structural.

## Related: production-readiness backlog (from the July 2026 deep audit)

Tracked here so nothing surfaced during the security/responsive audit gets silently lost.
**Resolved** items are kept (not deleted) so the history of what was found and fixed stays
visible — this file is a living reference, not a changelog.

**Resolved:**
- ~~Touch-target sizing sweep~~ — every icon-button previously sized `h-6`/`h-7 w-6`/`w-7`
  (24–28px) across Tickets (checklist/links/attachments), Users, the rich-text-editor toolbar,
  the file-dropzone remove button, and workspace-settings routing-rule rows is now `h-9 w-9`
  (36px), closer to the ~44px mobile tap-target guideline while staying visually compact in
  dense table rows.
- ~~SLA-sweep write ordering~~ — `sla.service.ts`/`ticket-sla.service.ts` now write the breach
  marker (`slaBreachAt`) atomically together with the `Escalation`/`TicketEscalation` row it
  implies (`prisma.$transaction`), not as a separate write beforehand — a crash between the two
  can no longer permanently mark a breach "handled" with no escalation ever created.
- ~~`GlobalAISettings.autoTriageAutoApply`~~ — now wired end-to-end: the ticket-create dialog
  reads this toggle and pre-fills the AI triage suggestion directly (with a visible
  "auto-applied by AI" indicator, still editable) instead of requiring an Accept click, exactly
  matching what the settings UI's description always promised.
- ~~Auto-ticket creation from CRITICAL/HIGH findings~~, ~~AI CI-failure triage~~, and
  ~~deterministic auto-reopen on regression~~ (theme #4 above) — all implemented: a fallback
  project (Workspace Settings → Security & DevOps) turns an unattached CRITICAL/HIGH finding
  into a ticket; a FAILED test run with a `failureText` excerpt gets an AI root-cause comment
  (`ciFailureTriageEnabled`, its own AI budget-gated toggle); a FAILED run referencing a
  RESOLVED/CLOSED ticket reopens it (`autoReopenEnabled`, deterministic, no AI, always
  audit-logged + notifies the assignee) — all three verified live against a running instance.
- ~~TL/Manager mapping — new surfaces on existing data~~ (part of theme #5) — an org-chart tree
  view now lives on the Team page (`GET /api/team/org-chart`), reading the existing
  `User.managerId` self-relation with no new schema; privileged roles see the whole company,
  everyone else sees their own subtree, system reporter-of-record accounts filtered out.
- ~~Kanban swimlanes by reporting line~~ (the other half of theme #5) — `TicketKanban.tsx` now
  has a "Group by manager" toggle that builds per-manager swimlanes (`buildSwimlanes`, keyed by
  `assignee.manager`, with an "Unassigned / no manager" fallback lane) and keeps drag-and-drop
  working across lanes via `${laneKey}::${status}` droppable IDs.
- ~~VAPT report upload + parsing~~ — `POST /security-ingestion/vapt-report` accepts a
  structured JSON report (assessor + findings) from Workspace Settings → Security & DevOps and
  creates `SecurityFinding` rows with `type: "VAPT"`, optionally attached to a ticket by key —
  deliberately JSON-only, not arbitrary PDF parsing (unreliable across report layouts).
- ~~Wide-table → mobile card-view fallback~~ — the Tickets list and Team page's escalations/
  direct-reports tables now pair a `hidden sm:table` desktop table with an `sm:hidden` card-list
  view carrying the same data, matching the pattern already used elsewhere in the app.
- ~~Expanded Playwright responsive coverage~~ — `tests/e2e/responsive.spec.ts` now covers 9
  routes (added `/app/history`, `/app/team`, `/app/users`, `/app/settings`), a tab-overflow
  regression check (`assertEveryTabIsReachable`) for Workspace Settings and the ticket detail
  sheet, and a new `platform-admin console` describe block for `/platform-admin/*`.
- ~~Git repo/branch/PR mapping~~ (scoped) — implemented as **manual** linking first: a new
  `TicketBranch` model (repository/branch/prUrl/prStatus, free text) surfaces on a **Dev** tab
  in the ticket detail sheet, same CRUD pattern as the existing Links panel.
- ~~Live git-provider App integration~~ (GitHub) — `GitConnection` model + a standard GitHub
  OAuth App flow (each org brings its own client id/secret, same bring-your-own-app-registration
  model `OrgSsoConfig` uses for Google/Microsoft SSO — see `services/git-provider.service.ts`'s
  header for why org identity travels through a signed `state` param rather than the Host
  header, mirroring `sso.service.ts` exactly). Once connected, the Dev tab's "Pick from GitHub"
  section lists live repos/PRs instead of typing a branch in by hand, still writing into the
  same `TicketBranch` row. **Scope note**: read-only REST calls only (list repos/branches/PRs)
  — no push/PR-event webhook receiver yet, so a `TicketBranch` row still doesn't auto-update
  when a PR merges on GitHub's side; that auto-sync-on-webhook slice is the natural next step,
  deliberately left out of this pass to keep it independently reviewable/testable. GitLab/
  Bitbucket are unbuilt — GitHub was the first provider implemented.
- ~~Auto testing on branch/PR push~~ (the workflow-rule half of theme #2 — `TestRun` ingestion
  itself already existed) — `GlobalTicketSettings.blockResolveOnFailingTests` (off by default,
  Workspace Settings → Ticketing) blocks a ticket's `PATCH /:id/status` transition to `RESOLVED`
  when its single latest ingested `TestRun` is `FAILED`; the Kanban card also shows a red
  "CI failing" badge (`TicketKanban.tsx`) sourced from the same `testRuns` include on the list
  endpoint, so a failing build is visible without opening the ticket.
- ~~Public REST API + outbound webhooks~~ (theme "Integrations", called out as "the single
  biggest structural gap today") — `ApiKey` (named, revocable, READ/WRITE-scoped bearer keys)
  gates `GET/POST /api/public/v1/*` (list/get/create tickets, list timesheets); `OutboundWebhook`
  fires an HMAC-SHA256-signed (`X-TimeSphere-Signature`, same trust model as GitHub/Stripe
  webhooks) JSON POST on `ticket.created`/`ticket.status_changed`/`ticket.closed`/
  `timesheet.submitted`/`timesheet.approved`. Both configured from Workspace Settings →
  **Public API**; see `docs/API.md`'s "Public API" section for the full contract.

- ~~Push/PR-event webhook receiver~~ for the GitHub integration above —
  `controllers/git-webhook.controller.ts` (`POST /api/git/webhook/:orgSlug`, a **per-repo**
  webhook the admin adds manually on GitHub since a plain OAuth App has no org-wide webhook the
  way a GitHub App does — the shared secret is generated from Workspace Settings → Security &
  DevOps → Git provider). `push` and `pull_request` events auto-create/update `TicketBranch`
  rows by matching a ticket-key-shaped token (e.g. `WEB-123`) in the branch name — same
  Jira/GitHub "smart commit" convention every similar integration uses, not a TimeSphere-specific
  scheme. Verified live: real `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC verification (valid + invalid cases),
  push events creating a `TicketBranch`, PR-opened/merged events updating `prUrl`/`prStatus`.
- ~~AI PR-review summaries~~ (part of theme #4) — `ai.service.ts#summarizePullRequest`
  (`aiPrReviewSummaryEnabled`, off by default) posts an AI-authored summary comment on the
  matched ticket when a PR's `pull_request` webhook fires with `action: "opened"` — same
  untrusted-content delimiting `classifyCiFailure` gives CI log text, since PR title/description
  are GitHub-supplied, not authenticated-user-supplied. A failure (AI disabled, budget cap, bad
  token) is caught and logged, never turns a successful branch sync into a failed webhook
  delivery — verified live via a deliberately-invalid access token.
- ~~Public API write scope beyond ticket creation~~ — `PATCH /api/public/v1/tickets/:key/status`
  (re-enforces the same `ticketStatusTransitions` legality rule and `blockResolveOnFailingTests`
  CI gate the authenticated route does) and `POST /api/public/v1/tickets/:key/comments`, both
  WRITE-scope-gated and attributed to the API key's creator. Verified live: illegal transition
  rejected (422), CI gate enforced identically to the authenticated route, READ-scope key
  rejected on both new routes (403).

**Still open:**
- **GitLab/Bitbucket OAuth** — the GitHub OAuth flow above is provider #1; the same
  `GitConnection`/`services/git-provider.service.ts` shape generalizes, but the other two
  providers' REST APIs and OAuth quirks haven't been implemented yet.
- **Timesheet writes via the public API** — creating a timesheet entry legitimately needs the
  same overlap-detection/SLA-deadline logic `timesheet.controller.ts#saveTimesheet` already
  owns; this is a `saveTimesheet` extraction, not new logic, and was deliberately left for that
  follow-up rather than duplicated under time pressure (see `public-api.controller.ts`'s header
  comment).
