# Changelog

All notable changes to TimeSphere, newest first. Each version corresponds to a git tag `vX.Y.Z`
and a GitHub Release whose body is copied from the matching section here — the release process is
documented in CONTRIBUTING.md, and the in-app **What's new** page renders these notes for every
user of a running installation.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-03

### ✨ Features

- **Guided product tour** — a role-aware walkthrough that navigates to each page the signed-in
  person can actually reach, spotlights what matters and blurs the rest. Auto-starts once for
  brand-new accounts; available any time from the profile menu → *Take the tour*.
- **First-run setup gate** — new accounts complete their profile (and face enrolment, where the
  workspace requires it) before using the app. Existing users are never affected.
- **Verified Work Attestations** — a signed, page-numbered PDF of approved, identity-verified work
  for a project and period, with client-viewable share links that need no account.
- **AI quality loop** — capture what the AI was asked and answered, correct real failures into
  golden datasets, edit prompts without a deploy (with automatic fallback to the built-in prompt),
  and replay datasets through an eval runner with hard budget caps. "Is the new prompt better?"
  becomes a number.
- **BYOK model picker** — the AI settings fetch the models your provider key can actually use,
  instead of asking you to type a model name from memory.
- **Attachment pipeline** — images convert to WebP (~76% smaller), text compresses losslessly,
  and every file gets an identifiable name plus type/size/checksum metadata for analytics.
- **Verification log controls** — search, outcome/context filters and sortable columns on the
  face-verification review log, on phones as well as desktop.
- **Update awareness** — the app knows its own version (`/api/system/version`), tells admins when
  a newer release exists, shows release notes in-app (*What's new*), and offers everyone a
  one-click refresh when the server is upgraded beneath them.
- **Backend health gate** — a warning strip on the first dropped request, a blocking overlay on a
  real outage, automatic recovery with no reload and no lost work.
- **Maintenance mode** — super admins schedule a window with an optional message; everyone else
  is locked out onto a branded maintenance page with a live countdown while super admins stay
  signed in to do the work. Includes a who's-online panel, a "wrap up" warning (in-app + email,
  with its own notification toggle), one-click force-logout of all non-admin sessions, and an
  advance-warning banner inside the app during the scheduled phase.
- **Server health panel** — the Maintenance tab shows live vitals of the serving instance,
  refreshed every 10 seconds: CPU, memory, disk, database ping / event-loop latency, and a
  component checklist (API, both databases, mail transport) that stays honest when something is
  down instead of erroring out.
- **Login visibility in User management** — every user row shows a live online indicator, first
  login and latest login times, plus a confirmed *sign out everywhere* action that revokes all
  of one person's sessions server-side.
- **Instant "you've been signed out" dialog** — a 15-second session heartbeat means an admin's
  force-logout reaches the person's open tab within seconds: a clear dialog explains what
  happened and takes them to the sign-in page, instead of a stale screen that only admits the
  truth on the next refresh. Ordinary session expiry gets the same treatment with softer wording.
- **Maintenance pop-up warning** — when a window is scheduled, signed-in users now get a one-time
  modal interruption (people tune out passive banners) quoting the window and the admin's
  message, acknowledged once per window per browser. The persistent amber banner stays as the
  ambient reminder.

### 🐛 Fixes

- Opening any menu or dialog after scrolling no longer breaks the page layout (sidebar/topbar
  vanishing, content shifting sideways). Root cause: `overflow-x: clip` on the root element
  blocked the standard scroll-lock from reaching the viewport, detaching every sticky element;
  the scrollbar-width jump is also gone (`scrollbar-gutter: stable`).
- Wide tables (Tickets, Users) on tablet-width screens now scroll horizontally inside their own
  container instead of being silently clipped at the right edge with no scrollbar — a
  pre-existing bug the old root-level clip both caused the conditions for and hid from the
  responsive test suite.
- The whole UI now fits comfortably at 100% browser zoom (previously only at ~80%): the root
  font size is 14px — the standard enterprise-app base — which scales every rem-based size in
  the app to 87.5%.
- The User management table no longer overflows horizontally: the six per-row icon buttons are
  consolidated into one labeled actions menu, which also puts *Delete* behind a clearer,
  harder-to-fat-finger step.
- Creating a user with an email that already exists now answers a clear conflict message instead
  of an unhandled server error — including when the collision is with a previously deleted
  account, which is invisible in every list.
- Workspace Settings no longer overflows on phones (a grid min-content bug affected every tab).
- Timesheet entries can now be deleted (drafts and rejected only — approved hours are part of the
  billing record and stay immutable).
- The pricing page's plan comparison is now generated from the same limits the platform enforces,
  correcting two rows that promised features on the wrong tier.
- Fresh-database provisioning no longer fails on the attachment migration.
- Six dialogs gained proper screen-reader descriptions; duplicate accessible names were resolved.

### 🔒 Security

- `sanitize-html` upgraded past GHSA-vccv-cmxp-4j9h (the vulnerable attributes were never in this
  app's allowlists; upgraded regardless, with the analysis pinned as tests).
- `npm audit` now blocks CI at high severity for production dependencies.
- Prompt editing is allowlisted away from every capability whose prompt carries prompt-injection
  delimiters or must produce parseable JSON.
